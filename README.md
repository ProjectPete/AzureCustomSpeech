# Azure Audio Transcription and Custom Speech

This project demonstrates how to transcribe audio from your media. With this tool, you can then tidy up the transcribed text into bite-sized chunks and feed back into Azure Custom Voice service. In a few simple steps you can recreate the voice and make the original speaker say anything you want!

You can take as little as ten minutes audio from friends, family or a video of your favourite star. This project shows how to use Azure Speech service, to transcribe speech to text. You then curate the snippets and feed them back into Azure Custom Voice service, to generate a surprisingly similar sounding voice! Finally, I show how to feed text back in, to generate your own audio files using the custom voice!

All you need is a free Azure subscription and a free Speech Service key.
