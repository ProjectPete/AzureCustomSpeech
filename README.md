# Azure Cognitive Services - Speech Services

## Video/Audio Transcription, Custom Speech, Subtitling (captioning)

This project demonstrates how to transcribe audio from your media.

* With this tool, you can then tidy up the transcribed text into bite-sized chunks and feed back into Azure Custom Voice service. 

* In a few simple steps you can recreate the voice and make the original speaker say anything you want!

* You can take as little as ten minutes audio from friends, family or a video of your favourite star. 

* This project shows how to use Azure Speech service, to transcribe speech to text.

* You can use many types of media, because the project will strip the Wave (sound) file out of a video like mp4 or mov, whatever NAudio is compatible with.

* You then curate the snippets and feed them back into Azure Custom Voice service, to generate a surprisingly similar sounding voice!

* Then, you can feed text back in, to generate your own audio files using the custom voice!

* You can also export the "timed text" in a couple of popular formats. The TTML format will work with the baked in Windows 10 "Films & TV" app.
