# Azure Cognitive Services: Free Speech Service
# A Realistic Sounding Voice of Anyone in Minutes!

## Video/Audio Transcription, Custom Speech, Subtitling (captioning)


This project demonstrates how to transcribe audio from your media.

* With this tool, you can then tidy up the transcribed text into bite-sized chunks and feed back into Azure Custom Voice service. 

* In a few simple steps you can recreate the voice and make the original speaker [say anything you want!](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-wikis-components-files/00-00-00-00-05/6888.Martin-Fake-Voice-V2.wav)

* You can take as little as ten minutes audio from friends, family or a video of your favourite star.

* This project shows how to use Azure Speech service, to transcribe speech to text.

* You can use many types of media, because the project will strip the Wave (sound) file out of a video like mp4 or mov, whatever NAudio is compatible with.

* You then curate the snippets and feed them back into Azure Custom Voice service, to generate a surprisingly similar sounding voice!

* Then, you can feed text back in, to generate your own audio files using the custom voice!

* You can also export the "timed text" in a couple of popular formats. The TTML format will work with the baked in Windows 10 "Films & TV" app.

This Cognitive Services implementation example is a contribution to the Microsoft [IT Implementer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/atwork/it-implementer/) initiative. 
Demystifying the latest tech and demonstrating how to actually implement it yourself!

I am also very proud to have been awarded the MVP (Most Valuable Professional) award for three years.

But of course, just passing on fun stuff that I learn along the way, is the main driver and a great pleasure.
